Gregory
-------
hello and welcome to the gregory github repository. Feel free to build and add on the existing code

### Reasouces 
This discord bot is running on my raspberry pi 3b+ 24/7. This Pi is also running mariaDB which is an sql server. For some commands, you can request new SQL tables are made and i can format it for you. Also, important credentials are stored in a .env file so if you wish to run a copy of gregory, you need to modify your .env file appropiately.

### Making your own commands
